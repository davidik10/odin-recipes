        <h2>Crepe</h2>
        <p>Crêpes are very thin pancakes. They can be served with a wide variety of sweet and savory fillings and toppings.</p> 
        <p>The breakfast staple dates back to at least 13th-century France.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>½ cup milk</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Whisk flour and eggs together in a large mixing bowl; gradually add in milk and water,</p> <p>stirring to combine. Add salt and melted butter; beat until smooth.</p></li>
            <li><p>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle,</p><p> using approximately 1/4 cup for each crêpe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</p></li>
            <li><p>Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes.</p><p>Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen the crêpe; flip and cook until the other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Serve hot.</p></li>
        </ol>
